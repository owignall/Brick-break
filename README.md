# Brick-break

**Version 1.0.0**

In this is a python game the user breaks bricks using a ball/s which bounce off a paddle. Once all bricks are broken the game loads the next level until the end of the game is reached. If the player misses the ball with the paddle then the current level will reload.

There is room for plenty of additions to this game including:
* Additional levels
* Additional power ups

The motivation for this program was for me to practice and improve my personal coding skills in python with an entertaining project. I welcome anyone to make use of this code and make their own changes.

## Prerequisits
